            <h2>High school without diplomas</h2>
            <p>Both brothers attended high school, but received no diplomas. The family's sudden move in 1884 from
                Richmond, Indiana, to Dayton, Ohio, where the family had lived during the 1870s, prevented Wilbur from
                receiving his diploma after finishing four years of high school.</p>

            <h2>Self-reliance</h2>
            <p>Orville dropped out of high school after his junior year to start a printing business in 1889, having
                designed and built
                his own printing press with Wilbur's help. Wilbur joined the print shop, and in March the brothers
                launched a weekly
                newspaper, the West Side News. In December 1892 the brothers opened a repair and sales shop (the Wright
                Cycle Exchange,
                later the Wright Cycle Company) and in 1896 began manufacturing their own brand.</p>

            <h2>Where it all began</h2>
            <p>In 1900, the brothers went to Kitty Hawk, North Carolina, to begin their manned gliding experiments after designing some
            gliders based on previous pioneers. After successfully manufacturing airplanes, they patented their inventions and their
            company (The Wright Company) set up a factory in Dayton and a flying school/test flight field at Huffman Prairie.</p>
