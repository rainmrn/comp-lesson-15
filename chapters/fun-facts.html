                        Carolina. Older brother Wilbur won the toss, but his first attempt on December 14, 1903, was
                        unsuccessful and caused
                        minor damage to the aircraft.</h4>

                        playing an ice-skating game with
                        friends, resulting in the loss of his front teeth. He became withdrawn since then, spending the
                        next few years largely housebound and gave up all of his dreams.</h4>
