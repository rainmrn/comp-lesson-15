                and Susan Catherine Koerner (1831–1889), of German and Swiss ancestry.</p>

                <p>Wilbur was born near Millville, Indiana, in 1867; Orville in Dayton, Ohio, in 1871. The other Wright siblings were Reuchlin (1861–1920), Lorin (1862–1939), Katharine (1874–1929), and twins Otis and Ida
                (born 1870, died in infancy). The direct paternal ancestry goes back to a Samuel Wright (b. 1606 in Essex, England) who sailed to America and settled in Massachusetts in 1636.</p>
                <p>None of the Wright children had middle names. Instead, their father tried hard to give them distinctive first names.
                Wilbur was named for Willbur Fisk and Orville for Orville Dewey, both clergymen that Milton Wright admired.[22] They
                were "Will" and "Orv" to their friends and in Dayton, their neighbors knew them simply as "the Bishop's kids", or "the
                Bishop's boys".</p>
